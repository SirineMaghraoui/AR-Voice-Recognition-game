An Augmented Reality video game that is playable by Voice Recognition. The player plays and controls the different features in the gameplay through voice commands. It's a game app featuring 3 mini games:

- Mini game 2: A UFO which the player controls it's movements (up, down, right, left) to avoid or shoot obstacle and collect objects
- Mini game 3: A car that the player controls its path driving around the scene. The player also controls the car behavior (start, stop, speed up, slow down, changing gears…)
